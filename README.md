Sargon Chess for CP/M

I found the source code to Sargon Chess from https://github.com/billforsternz/retro-sargon/blob/master/stages/sargon-z80.asm
Sadly it is specific to a certain computer system, but I want it to run under CP/M.
Yes, I know there is already a CP/M version of Sargon, but it is a poor one. I want to make one with better graphics.
So, this is my attempt at it.
